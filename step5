You found two witness interview files. Take a look inside both of them and save any useful information into a new file called 'interview_info.txt'.

You feel satisfied that you have covered your tracks - time to consolidate your files. Commit the file but DON'T PUSH IT YET!

First checkout back into the 'master' branch, and merge the 'step-5' branch into 'master'.

cat ./mystery/interviews/interview-47246024 > interview_info.txt
cat ./mystery/interviews/interview-699607 >> interview_info.txt
